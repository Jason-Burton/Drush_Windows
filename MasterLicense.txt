5. Disclaimer of Warranties. 
THE SOFTWARE AND ANY RELATED DATA OR OTHER SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITH NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. ACQUIA EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO AND WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SECURITY, RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR ADEQUACY OF THE SOFTWARE, THE SERVICES OR ANY DATA ACCESSED THEREFROM, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, QUIET PERFORMANCE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ACQUIA MAKES NO PROMISES, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE OR THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ITS CONDITION, ITS CONFORMITY TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR DESCRIPTION, OR THE EXISTENCE OF ANY LATENT OR PATENT DEFECTS.

YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND ANY RELATED DATA OR SERVICE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY, USE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.

6. Limitation of Liability.
ACQUIA SHALL IN NO EVENT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE (INCLUDING LOSS OR DAMAGE INCURRED FROM THIRD PARTIES), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR ANY DATA ACCESSED THROUGH THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, DAMAGES FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT OR REVENUE, INJURY TO PERSON OR PROPERTY, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OR PERSONAL INFORMATION, EVEN IF ACQUIA IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SUCH LIMITATION SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

8. Severability; No General Waiver.
If any provision of this Agreement is contrary to, prohibited by or deemed invalid under applicable law or regulation, such provision shall be inapplicable and deemed omitted to the extent so contrary, prohibited or invalid, but the remainder of this Agreement shall not be invalidated thereby and shall be given full force and effect so far as possible. If any provision of this Agreement may be construed in two or more ways, one of which would render the provision invalid or otherwise voidable or unenforceable and another of which would render the provision valid and enforceable, such provision shall have the meaning which renders it valid and enforceable. The failure of Acquia to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. 

9. Acquia's Remedies.
Acquia may be irreparably damaged if this Agreement is not specifically enforced, and damages at law would be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Agreement by you, Acquia shall be entitled, in addition to all rights and remedies, to an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach, without being required to show any actual damage or to post an injunction bond, and/or to a decree for specific performance of the provisions of this Agreement.

This Agreement is to be governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard for principles of conflicts of laws.

The arbitrator shall be selected by you and Acquia, and if you and Acquia are unable to reach agreement on selection of the arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the notice of arbitration is served, then the arbitrator shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive upon you and Acquia and your and Acquia's respective administrators, executors, legal representatives, successors and assigns, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
